### Overview:

DimmerAttenuation is a flexible Python library tailored for utilizing legacy
Fortran 2003+ routines. These routines enable the correction of observed
spectra or emission lines through attenuation laws. Additionally,
DimmerAttenuation facilitates the application of attenuation to hypothetical
spectra, such as models.
