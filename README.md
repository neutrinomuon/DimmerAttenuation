<tr><td>19/12/2022</td>
<td>J.G. changed nomenclature from Remission to Reemission. All directories and routines were affected</td></tr>

<tr><td>18/11/2022</td>
<td>A.P. added photometric and output directories to PyDust</td></tr>


<tr><td>24/10/2022</td>
<td>J.G. added new format for LOGs added. Verification and change of directory structure</td></tr>

<tr><td>16/10/2021</td>
<td>J.G. uploaded the routines concerning absorption in the UV/Optical. Try to plot them as a function of wavelength from 91 to 15000 Angstroms to see the different behavior of extinction laws.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15/01/2022</td>
<td>J.G. uploaded correction for the reddening laws. We can use as well to compare the extinction package, but it is limited to a few extinction laws.<p>

J.G. added a directory called Literature. Please feel free to include papers of interest.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>14/01/2022</td>
<td>J.G. uploaded the recorded video from our joint meeting on 13/01/2022. The purpose of this meeting was to have a first grasp of the PyDust.py module.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12/01/2022</td>
<td>J.G. uploaded the PyDust module written in Python.</td></tr>

<tr><td>05/06/2023</td>
<td>J.G. modified the PyDust module in order to implement optimisation</td></tr>

<tr><td>25/09/2023</td> <td>J.G. modified the name PyDust to DustyGlow, since
there was during this year a registration of the PyDust package on the PyPI
library, which is not related to astronomy.</td></tr>

<tr><td>25/09/2023</td> <td>J.G. registered the name DustyGlow in the PyPI
platform.</td></tr>

<tr><td>05/10/2023</td><td>J.G. Optimisation function in class DustyGlow is working. Fixed some major/minor problems! Scipy, MCMC tests</td></tr>
